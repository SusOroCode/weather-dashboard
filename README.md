# weather-dashboard

## Description

In this challenge, I was asked to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The application should show the current weather, a 5 day weather forecast and a search history of previously searched cities that are displayed as buttons. When clicked, the past search city should display the current weather and forecast by using local storage. The API was given for this project.
